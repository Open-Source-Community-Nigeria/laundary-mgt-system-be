# Laundry Management System Backend

## Introduction

This repository contains the backend code for the Laundry Management System, an open-source project aimed at managing laundry services. The backend is built using modern web technologies and follows industry best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for building the server-side application.
- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database, chosen for its scalability and flexibility in handling large amounts of unstructured data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for securing API endpoints by providing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a schema-based solution to model data.
- **bcrypt**: A library for hashing passwords to ensure secure storage of user credentials.
- **dotenv**: A module for loading environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, used for managing configuration.
- **Nodemon**: A utility that automatically restarts the Node.js application when file changes are detected, useful during development.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:

- **models/**: Contains the Mongoose schemas and models for MongoDB.
- **controllers/**: Contains the logic for handling requests and returning responses.
- **routes/**: Defines the API routes and connects them with the appropriate controllers.
- **middlewares/**: Contains middleware functions for tasks like authentication, validation, etc.
- **config/**: Holds configuration files, such as database connection settings.
- **utils/**: Utility functions that can be used across the project.

## Installation

To get started with the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Open-Source-Community-Nigeria/laundary-mgt-system-be.git
   ```
````

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd laundary-mgt-system-be
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```bash
   PORT=9000
   MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
   ```

5. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application will start on `http://localhost:9000`.
